# Project Title: Loan Default Prediction (Further details in reports folder)

## Problem Statement

In the heavily regulated financial industry, accurate and explainable loan default prediction models are crucial for ensuring financial stability and minimizing risk. This project focuses on building, comparing, and critically explaining various machine learning models for predicting loan defaults, with an emphasis on regulatory compliance and ethical decision-making.

## Objectives

1. **Develop Robust Models**: Experiment with a range of machine learning algorithms including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting (GBM or XGBoost), Neural Networks, and ensemble methods (e.g., StackingClassifier, AutoGluon).

2. **Rigorous Evaluation**: Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, and Precision-Recall curves.

3. **Prioritize Explainability**: Utilize techniques like LIME, SHAP, feature importance, and partial dependence plots to understand model reasoning and ensure compliance.

4. **Operationalize Insights**: Propose thresholds aligned with desired false positive rates (2% and 5%) with clear implications for precision, recall, and business outcomes.

5. **Thorough Documentation**: Provide a well-structured report outlining methodology, results, and actionable recommendations.

## Methodology

### Data Exploration and Preprocessing

- Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain insights into data distribution, missing values, and outliers.
- Clean and prepare data, including addressing missing values, handling categorical features, and potential normalization or scaling.

### Model Development

- Train and compare the performance of various models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, GBM/XGBoost, Neural Network, and ensemble models (GBM, XGBoost, Logistic, Random Forest).
- Explore hyperparameter tuning techniques such as grid search, randomized search for model optimization.

### Model Explainability

- Generate global explanations such as feature importance rankings and partial dependence plots to understand the model's overall logic.
- Produce local explanations by analyzing individual predictions (top true positives, false positives, false negatives) to pinpoint patterns in decision-making.

### Operational Strategy

- Align model thresholds with business goals, recommending strategies to achieve specific false positive rates while discussing precision and recall trade-offs.
